# FlaminCode

A series of challenge made by ESIEA Paris' Robotics Association (DTRE). 

###### 1. FizzBuzz (week 43) ; Language : Unspecified (yikes)
Implemented a working recursive C version
BrainFuck code structurally complete, debugging still in progress (seriously, this lang is a PAIN to debug)...
Probably a few offset bugs here and there messing up the whole thing, and I'd also like to optimize space management.
Either way, I'm done with this.
